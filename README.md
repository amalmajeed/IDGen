# IDGen
Mini Project for College ID Card Generation System for Students and Faculty.


  This was an academic project that aims to build a semi adaptable template based ID Card Generation System for Student and Faculty ID card generation for my College.This system can be employed at any academic instituion with a more optimized adaptable template schema.

  The project was done on the Django 1.9 python web development framework powered by python v2.7.11.So the project structure is as follows.
    
            idcard - Project settings root folder.
  
            upload - App is named upload and all the models and views and app urls are written in there.
  
            static - All the static files used for bootstrapping the front-end can be found here.
